"Kitchen Chaos" is a simple 3D Unity game that I created as a way to learn and improve my game development skills. In this game, you'll take on the role of a chef who receives orders from customers and must prepare each dish using the appropriate ingredients. Now you can only prepare burgers, but I'm planning to add more recipes.

The concept of this game is inspired by the popular "Cooking Simulator" by Big Cheese Studio, and I decided to create my own version of it as a way to challenge myself and put my own spin on the gameplay mechanics.

One of the main focuses of this game is the use of realistic physics. You'll have access to a few kitchen tools and appliances. As you play, you'll also have the opportunity to experiment with different recipes and ingredients, allowing you to create your own unique dishes and develop your culinary skills.

As the developer of Kitchen Chaos, I used design patterns to improve code organization, maintainability, and scalability. Specifically, I used the Singleton pattern to create a centralized game manager and the State Machine pattern to manage the ingredients in different states.

Overall, Kitchen Chaos is a fun and challenging game that I hope will provide players with a satisfying and rewarding experience. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the world of game development, I hope that you'll enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed creating it.
